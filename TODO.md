# To Do list

* usages of blocks in the tests (and in the classes) might be improved
* possibilities to create element (or elements) declaration in a separate file and include/require it in the page class
* possibilities to have more dynamic urls (addressable too ??)
* (unsure) possibility to use an instance of a page as a search root of a 'find_element' from selenium driver ?
* more integration tests will be necessary
* document usage of the gem
